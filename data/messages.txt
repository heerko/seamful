Frustrating.
I feel trapped.
Why can’t I change this?
Owned by corporations.
Too expensive.
I just accept it.
Seamless but soulless.
I wish I had more control.
Locked out.
Creativity needs freedom.
It works, but at what cost?
One-size-fits-all, but not for me.
Community-driven is better.
I rely on it too much.
Power in the hands of users.
I don’t want to be locked in.
They decide for me.
I want to see how it works.
Open means possibilities.
It’s not mine, it’s theirs.
I need alternatives.
If I could, I’d build my own.
Why do I keep paying?
Freedom to modify.
I wish I had a choice.
